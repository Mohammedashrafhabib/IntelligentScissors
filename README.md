# IntelligentScissors
 
Built responsive desktop app with C# and concepts of
graph algorithm(dijkstra) which we use for image
segmentation,Intelligent Scissors allow objects within
digital images to be extracted quickly and accurately
using simple gesture motions with a mouse. When
clicked mouse to an object edge and wraps around the
object of interest.Livewire boundary detection by
dijkstra algorithm that calc best distance between
colores to detect clicked object. Detected object by
high proformance speed.
